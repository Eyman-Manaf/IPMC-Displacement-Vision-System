# IPMC-Displacement-Vision-System

### This code pretains to a published work on a computer vision system developed to measure the displacement and bending angle of ionic polymer-metal composite (IPMC). The abstract of the work is as follows:

*A computer vision system to measure the displacement and bending angle of ionic polymer-metal composite (IPMC) was proposed. The logical progression of 	measuring IPMC displacement and bending angle was laid out. This study used Python (version 3.10) in conjunction with OpenCV (version 4.5.5.64) for the vision system development. The coding functions and the mathematical formulas used were elaborated. IPMC contour detection was discussed in detail, along with appropriate camera and lighting setups. Measurements generated from the vision system were compared to approximated values via manual calculation method. Good agreement was found between the results produced by the two methods. Mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE) for displacement values are 0.068080668 and 0.088160652 respectively, and 0.081544205 and 0.103880163 respectively for bending angle values. The proposed vision system can accurately approximate the displacement and bending angle of IPMCs. The code is made open access with the GitHub link made available in the supplementary materials section.*
